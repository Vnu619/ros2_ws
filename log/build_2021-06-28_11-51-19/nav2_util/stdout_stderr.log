CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:18 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findbondcpp.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "bondcpp", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "bondcpp" with any
  of the following names:

    bondcppConfig.cmake
    bondcpp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "bondcpp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "bondcpp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "bondcpp" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
